    <h5>ACT III. —</h5> <p id="scene">SCENE I.—BÉRALDE, ARGAN, TOINETTE.</p>

    <h6 class="beralde">BER.</h6><p id="speech">Well, brother, what do you say to that? Isn't it as good as a
    dose of cassia?</p>

    <h6 class="toinette">TOI.</h6><p id="speech">Oh! good cassia is a very good thing, Sir.</p>

    <h6 class="beralde">BER.</h6><p id="speech">Now, shall we have a little chat together.</p>

    <h6 class="argan">ARG.</h6><p id="speech">Wait a moment, brother, I'll be back directly.</p>

    <h6 class="toinette">TOI.</h6><p id="speech">Here, Sir; you forget that you cannot get about without a stick.</p>

    <h6 class="argan">ARG.</h6><p id="speech">Ay, to be sure.</p>

    <p id="scene">SCENE II.—BÉRALDE, TOINETTE.</p>

    <h6 class="toinette">TOI.</h6><p id="speech">Pray, do not give up the interest of your niece.</p>

    <h6 class="beralde">BER.</h6><p id="speech">No, I shall do all in my power to forward her wishes.</p>

    <h6 class="toinette">TOI.</h6><p id="speech">We must prevent this foolish marriage which he has got into his
    head, from taking place. And I thought to myself that it would be a
    good thing to introduce a doctor here, having a full understanding of
    our wishes, to disgust him with his Mr. Purgon, and abuse his mode of
    treating him. But as we have nobody to act that part for us, I have
    decided upon playing him a trick of my own.</p>

    <h6 class="beralde">BER.</h6><p id="speech">In what way?</p>

    <h6 class="toinette">TOI.</h6><p id="speech">It is rather an absurd idea, and it may be more fortunate than
    good. But act your own part. Here is our man.</p>
